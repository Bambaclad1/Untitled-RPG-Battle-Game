## Introduction

This game is a sequel on the first C# RPG Battle game i have made, however, that was more focussing on story and less battle. This game takes a big focus on the battle system, and improves it by making it more userfriendly and better to play/configure. The code itself is also handled better as the previous one was a hell.
The game uses *NO* custom libaries for sound etc because for some reason that wasn't supported in a specific solution. Oh well..


# More to be added soon!
