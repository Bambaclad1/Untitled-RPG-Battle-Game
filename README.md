## Introduction

This game is a sequel on the first C# RPG Battle game i have made, however, that was more focussing on story and less battle. This game takes a big focus on the battle system, and improves it by making it more userfriendly and better to play/configure. The code itself is also handled better as the previous one was a hell.
The game uses *NO* custom libaries for sound etc because for some reason that wasn't supported in a specific solution. Oh well..


## Bad News

Really, i had a lot of plans for this game, the problem is that i couldn't get myself to add more cool stuff in the game itself. I wanted to add tons of things to this but just the time for doing so wasn't there.

## UML

## Code Showcase
I would say that for this time, the code is actually really neatly organized. One thing i could have done is used a singleton here:

but, ill do that next time.

I think that the code would be more optimalized if i were about to use Arrays/vectors for my code instead of keep creating the same int with another name.

The headers are done really nicely aswell especially with the use of getters and setters, eliminating the use of putting every damn variable on public.

## Version Control

Version control was done organized.
